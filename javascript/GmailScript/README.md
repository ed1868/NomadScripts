#Gmail Script to Categorize Emails
  This script will automatically categorize emails in your Gmail inbox based on keywords or sender in the subject line and apply a label to them. It will     also move emails from certain senders to a separate folder and add a snooze feature.

#Usage
  To use this script, follow these steps:

  Open Google Apps Script in your Google account.
  Create a new script file and copy the code from the example provided in the code.js file in this repository.
  Modify the keywords and sender variables in the code to match the keywords and sender email addresses you want to categorize and label.
  Modify the labelName variable to match the label you want to apply to the emails.
  Save the script and run it.


#Features
  This script will do the following:

  Categorize emails in your Gmail inbox based on specified keywords or sender in the subject line.  
  Apply a label to the categorized emails.
  Move emails from specified senders to the archive.
  Add a snooze feature to emails that contain the word "snooze" in the subject line.
  You can modify the script to add other features, such as automatically archiving emails that are older than a certain age or have been marked as read for   a specified amount of time.

#Notes
  This script will only categorize and label emails in your inbox. To categorize and label emails in other folders, you will need to modify the code.
  If you want to stop using the script, simply delete the label and the script will no longer categorize and label emails.
  That's it! With this script, you can streamline your inbox and keep your emails organized.
